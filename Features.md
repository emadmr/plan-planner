# Introduction #

One place where I can plan my day. I want to plan everything at one place, but have a way to see what I want. This planner will have a diet planner, Habits planner, Workouts planner, Spiritual planner integrated to Google Calendar/Task list.

There will be a master or you can say ideal plan. That ideal plan you will create, specifying in ideal world, how you want your day. A perfect food to eat, optimum workout, meditation, love life.

Then any day you can see how far are you from your ideal plan. When you deviated too far from that and when you were almost near your ideal plan.
